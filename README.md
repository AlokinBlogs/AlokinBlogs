Hiya! Welcome to my profile page. You must be here because of my attempts at making something interesting for people to compare their code to.
Thank you for visiting!

I am a computer science student in Bulgaria and am in love with all sorts of technology, in all of its directions - software and hardware.
I'm on GitHub to make my creations available to the public. My currently active repositories are:
- bitOS - a geeky operating system for the micro:bit board. Last version: v1.1.
- moveOS - a multi-component controller software designed for the micro:bit and the Kitronik :MOVE Mini kits. It is currently in development.

I hope to be able to push out:
- alokinOS - a Linux-based Live installation with my own set of tweaks and features. It is technically active, but unfinished and in the form of a virtual machine.
- A simplified experience for using a Raspberry Pi as a compact computer for everyday life.
